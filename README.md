# JavaFX-GUI-Bookstore-Application
This repository contains the source code and files for a user-friendly JavaFX GUI application that simulates a bookstore. The application allows users to browse and purchase books, earning points with each transaction. The points can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases.

## Features

#### Object-Oriented Design:
The application is built upon solid object-oriented principles, ensuring proper encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The codebase utilizes JavaFX for the graphical user interface.
#### Customer and Book Classes:
To enable the application's functionality, three main classes have been implemented, including a Customer class and a Book class. These classes are designed to handle customer accounts, book information, and ensure the smooth operation of the application.
#### Owner Management: 
The application incorporates an owner login functionality that provides privileged access to manage customer accounts and book inventory. Owners can view customer information, including earned points, and add or remove customers and books with their respective prices.
#### Customer Experience: 
Customers can create accounts and log in to the application. Once logged in, they can browse the available books, select their desired titles, and make purchases. Each purchase earns them points, which can be later redeemed for discounts on subsequent purchases, allowing customers to acquire more books for less.
